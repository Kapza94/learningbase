Learning base

This is probably where i am going to post all things regarding my learning and how i want to learn. 

I have gone throught the first 2 videos of CS50 and feel extremely lost so its scary not feeling like anything is clicking.
This is not a blog though so lets get to business.

First video was introduction where we learned about scratch and some logic steps. How to solve problems with this interactive game. 
Most of this applies to the language we are learning which is C so we will have to see how this goes. 
Overall im having trouble understanding some logic so i feel i need to work on my problem solving abilities. 
As well as when to use what and what goes where in code. Im gettng better though.

TODO:
1. Workout timeline to learn basics of HTML-CSS- JAVASCRIPT- timeline = 6-8 months. (DONE)

2. Plan time wise how im going to study how long per day? How many hours a day and how many hours on my free days do i want to study- GOAL is 2-3 hours a day

3. Prioritize my tasks into Urgent -high value- urgent low value- Not urgent high value and not urgent low value refer to the thinkful video below
                                    https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/
        
4. Re-Watch learning circle from minute 1:02:00 in video above and learn more about how to manage my learning. OInce Re-Watched make a google sheets file and 
   put it all on paper.
   
5. Not sure yet but will add something.


Learning Circle-

Everyones missing one piece to the pie.

Research- 

before you start something research everything you need to regarding that topic. Write down all the things you think you need to learn.
So that nothing will catch you by surprise. So write it down. Then through more research see what you need to start learning first. Dont go down rabbit hole. 

Content-

You have to apply your learning style. You need to do the content whilie learning LUKA!

Building-

This is where you have to make stuff. Make sure that whatever you are making is portfolio quaility.

Teaching-

Dont skip this- try to teach everything you learn. Whether that is to your rubber duck- to your girlfriend, mom whoever. Try to teach someone something to someone. 
This shows you have geniunly learnt something. Because if you are able to teach someone something you just learnt you probably know it very well.
